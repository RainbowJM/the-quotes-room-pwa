## Introduction
In this repository you will find my single page application (the client side web application) that I made in WAFS, but this time I will be refactor it in to a server side rendered application. Also I added more functionalitis to it. These were based on the Service Worker and I implemented also a series of optimisation to improve the performance of the application
